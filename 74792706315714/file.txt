### What is this?

This project is an OpenRewrite module that automates common migration tasks when upgrading OpenAPI specifications.  It offers a collection of recipes designed to streamline the transition process, reducing manual effort and the risk of errors.

### Recipes

This module provides several recipes to assist in migrating your OpenAPI specifications. These recipes handle tasks such as:

* **Migrating Swagger Annotations:**  Recipes are included to help migrate from older Swagger annotations to the newer OpenAPI annotation standards.  This includes converting `@ApiImplicitParam` annotations with `dataTypeClass` to the equivalent `@Parameter` annotations with `schema` and `implementation` properties.  The migration also handles display names and descriptions.

* **Migrating from Swagger API to OpenAPI Tags:** Recipes simplify the transition of annotations from Swagger's API declarations to OpenAPI 3's tag system.

* **Converting API Response Codes:** Recipes automatically convert API response codes from numeric formats to string representations.
